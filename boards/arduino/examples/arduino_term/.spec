<h1>Terminal</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to implement a simple terminal using an Arduino
Duemilanove.
</p>

<p>
The interface is a kfile object that is simple to write to and allows the use of
control codes to determine where on the display the text appears. This example
assumes a 20x4 display and shows the text being positioned and scrolled.
