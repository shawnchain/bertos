<h1>KISS g4xyw TNC</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to implement a KISS mode TNC on an Arduino
Duemilanove (or Nano) with an external high speed device such as a g4xyw 9k6 modem.
</p>

<p>
This device can be used to interface a variety of popular packet programs to a radio FSK
channel and allow half duplex communications via a serial port (UART).
