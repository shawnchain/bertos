<h1>WxTx</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to implement a replacement for a LaCrosse WS231x 
hydro (the outside) unit using an Arduino Duemilanove with an attached TX1 OOK transmitter.
</p>

<p>
This device uses its own 1-wire temperature and humidity sensors and the existing
rain tipper and TX20 or TX23 wind sensor from the original unit. The data is
compatible with the existing console or the associated WxRx example
</p>
