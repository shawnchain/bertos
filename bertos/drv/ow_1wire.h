	 * \defgroup 1wire_api 1-wire API
	 * This is the interface to the low level bit-bang driver
	 * Initialisation is only required if more that 1 I/O line is being used for multiple busses
	 *
	 * It is expected that the only interface to this code is to search for devices and to define the bus
	 * if multiple busses are in use.
	 *
	 * API usage example:
	 * \code
	 * uint8_t ids[4][OW_ROMCODE_SIZE];      // only expect to find 3 actually!!
	 *
	 * for (diff = OW_SEARCH_FIRST, cnt = 0; diff != OW_LAST_DEVICE; cnt++)
	 * {
	 * 	diff = ow_rom_search (diff, ids[cnt]);
	 *
	 * 	if ((diff == OW_PRESENCE_ERR) || (diff == OW_DATA_ERR))
	 * 		break;	// <--- early exit!
	 * 	if (crc8 (ids[cnt], 8))
	 * 		kfile_print(&ser.fd, "CRC suspect\r\n");
	 *
	 * 	switch (ids[cnt][0])
	 * 	{
	 * 	case SBATTERY_FAM:
	 * 	// note which device is of this type
	 * 		break;
	 * 	case DS18S20_FAMILY_CODE:
	 * 	case DS18B20_FAMILY_CODE:
	 * 	case DS1822_FAMILY_CODE:
	 * 		break;
